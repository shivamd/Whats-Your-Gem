Whats-Your-Gem
==============

Chrome extension that annotates gems in a Gemfile on Github.
I built this simple chrome extension because I was tired of asking myself 'What is this gem for?'

## Installation & Usage. 

Go the [extension's home page][1] using Google Chrome. Click on the add button. This should install the extension on to your browser. 
The extension is a script that runs in the background when you visit [Github][2]. In order to see the extension in action, browse a [Gemfile][3] or [two][4].
